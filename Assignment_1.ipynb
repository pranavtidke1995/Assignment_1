        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "  :- Python is an interpreted, object oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantis.\n",
        "   Python is popular because it is\n",
        "   . easy to learn\n",
        "   . Python is free to use and distribute even for commericial purpose\n",
        "   . python runs on many different platforms, including Linux, Mac OS and windows.\n",
        "   . Python integrates well with other popular programming languages such as Java, C, C++.\n",
        "   .Large standard library.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  :- An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine code that the computer can understand and execute. It acts as a bridge between the human-readable Python code and the underlying hardware of the computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  :- Predefined kyewords are special words that are part of the python language syntax. These keywords have specific meaning and purpose.\n",
        "  some common keywords are: if, else, for, while, AND, OR, NOT, True, false, none..etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable name?\n",
        "  :- No, Keywords cannot be used as vsribale name in Python if we do so it will throw error i.e Syntex Error: invalid syntex\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  :- In Python, mutability refers to the ability to change the value of an object after it has been created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable Objects:\n",
        " .Can be modified in-place.\n",
        " .Changes made to the object are reflected in all references to that object.\n",
        " .Examples: Lists, dictionaries, sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable Objects:\n",
        " .Cannot be changed after creation.\n",
        " .Creating a new object with the desired changes is necessary.\n",
        " .Examples: Integers, floats, strings, tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  :- In Python, lists are mutable, meaning you can change their contents after they are created. This flexibility allows you to add, remove, or modify elements within the list.\n",
        "\n",
        " On the other hand, tuples are immutable, which means their contents cannot be changed once they are created. This immutability has several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        " .Efficiency: Tuples are generally more memory-efficient than lists because they are static in size. This makes them faster to access and iterate over.\n",
        " .Hashing: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are hashable. Lists, being mutable, cannot be used as dictionary keys.\n",
        " .Data Integrity: Immutability ensures that the contents of a tuple remain unchanged, which can be important in certain situations where you want to guarantee that the data remains consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "  \n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "  :- In Python, both == and is operators are used for comparison, but they have different meanings:\n",
        "\n",
        "== (Equality Operator)\n",
        " .Checks if the values of two objects are equal.\n",
        " .Compares the contents of the objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "is (Identity Operator)\n",
        " .Checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory.\n",
        " .Compares the memory addresses of the objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  :- Logical operators in Python are used to combine multiple conditions and determine the overall truth value of an expression. They are essential for controlling the flow of your code based on different combinations of conditions. Python provides three main logical operators:\n",
        "Example: AND, OR, NOT.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "  :- Type casting in Python refers to the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. Python provides built-in functions for type casting, allowing developers to change the type of a variable explicitly.\n",
        "Common functions used:\n",
        "1.Explicit Type Casting:\n",
        ".int(): Converts to an integer.\n",
        ".float(): Converts to a floating-point number.\n",
        ".str(): Converts to a string.\n",
        ".bool(): Converts to a boolean.\n",
        ".list(): Converts to a list.\n",
        ".tuple(): Converts to a tuple.\n",
        ".set(): Converts to a set.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Implicit Type Casting:\n",
        ".Implicit Type Conversion: Python sometimes performs type conversion automatically (e.g., when dividing an integer by a float).\n",
        ".Explicit Type Conversion: You can explicitly perform type conversion using the functions mentioned above.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  :- 1.Implicit Type Casting:\n",
        " .Python automatically converts one data type to another without any user intervention. This happens when Python determines that the conversion is safe and won't result in data loss.\n",
        " .Occurs during operations involving different data types where Python promotes the \"lower precision\" type to a \"higher precision\" type to maintain accuracy.\n",
        "  2.Explicit Type Casting:\n",
        " .The programmer explicitly uses built-in functions to convert a variable from one data type to another.\n",
        " .Used when automatic conversion isn't available, or when a specific type is required for an operation or function.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        " :- The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of a program based on specific conditions. They allow a program to make decisions and execute certain blocks of code only when certain conditions are met.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  :- The elif statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions in a sequential manner. It stands for \"else if\" and allows you to test additional conditions if the initial if condition is False.\n",
        "If a condition in an elif statement evaluates to True, its corresponding block of code executes, and the rest of the elif and else blocks are skipped.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  :- 1. For Loop\n",
        "Definition: The for loop iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, string, tuple, range, dictionary) or other iterable objects. It is primarily used when the number of iterations is known or when you need to iterate over each element in a collection.\n",
        "Key Features:\n",
        " .Iterates over elements in a sequence.\n",
        " .Automatically stops when it reaches the end of the sequence.\n",
        " .Commonly used for iterating through data structures like lists, strings, or ranges.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   2.While Loop\n",
        "Definition: The while loop repeats as long as a specified condition remains True. It is used when the number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on a condition.\n",
        "Key Features:\n",
        ".Executes the block of code repeatedly as long as the condition is True.\n",
        ".Requires manual updates to variables affecting the condition to avoid infinite loops.\n",
        ".Commonly used for indefinite or condition-dependent iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "  :- Let's say you're writing a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer. You want to keep prompting the user until they enter a valid input.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why a While Loop is Better:\n",
        "\n",
        "Unknown Number of Iterations: You don't know how many times the user will enter invalid input. A while loop allows you to repeatedly ask for input until the condition (valid integer) is met.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "while True:\n",
        "    user_input = input(\"Enter a positive integer: \")\n",
        "    try:\n",
        "        number = int(user_input)\n",
        "        if number > 0:\n",
        "            break  # Exit the loop if the input is valid\n",
        "        else:\n",
        "            print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n",
        "    except ValueError:\n",
        "        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter an integer.\")\n",
        "In this scenario, a while loop is more suitable because:\n",
        "\n",
        " .Flexibility: It can handle an indefinite number of user attempts.\n",
        " .Clear Condition: The loop continues as long as a valid positive integer is not entered.\n",
        "This example demonstrates how a while loop excels when the number of iterations is uncertain and depends on user input or external events.\n"
